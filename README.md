# Task-Management
A single place for Backend and Frontend of Task Management. Backend is coded with C# using .net Framework. Front end is designed using HTML and JavaScript  

# API Tech 
# .net Framework / C#
As we want to create fast, lightweight, and cross-platform. It comes with Automatic routing, model binding, validation, and OpenAPI (Swagger) support and is Easy to deploy on Azure, AWS, or Docker. C# is a typesafe OOPS language. Easy to catch errors early than later. Also this helps us to extend the api further with minimal effort.

# Frontend Tech
# HTML and Javascript 
As the requirement for front end is very simple, so no need to go with other front end frameworks like react, angular. These simple api calls would be best to sit in Javascript. We hardly have 3 components for front end, Textbox, button and a list, So use of enterprise front end frameworks would be a overkill

You might have to adjust the port numbers from **launchSettings.json** if by default port is not available. Most common port used for this is **3000 or 5000**. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d824982-02c4-4333-830c-a5b159361b99)

If you have to change the port to make API Running, then you also have to change the **Backend Url** in front end code as well. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d1f0313-d481-4258-800b-b48da96326e0)

# Unit Tests
A **MS Unit Test** project is also added.

# Postman Collection
A postman collection is also added for quick and easy testing of the API. You just need to import the collection into postman and hit the endpoints without worry to change any parameters.

# How to add a new Task
As the Task Id is **autogenerated** and IsCompleted property is false by Default. So only two properties would be asked from user. Once the user enters the description and Created by, Clicks the button. Upon successful addition the new task appears in the task list.
